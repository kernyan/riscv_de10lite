# Tricky things

## main.c
1. doesn't have stack set up so ensure compiled output doesn't use 'sp'
  - check using riscv-embed-none-objdump -d a.out | grep sp
2. in src/riscv.v, firmware.hex maps to 64 4 bytes word, thus firmware.hex <= 64 lines

## on linux
1. by default, usb-uart device might not have write access
  - lsusb to check usb-uart device
  - ll /dev/usb/bus_id
  - chmod 666 'device_id'
